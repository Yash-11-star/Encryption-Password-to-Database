## Introduction

The project is designed to encrypt user passwords before storing them in a database. It employs encryption algorithms to secure sensitive user information, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Implements password encryption using secure algorithms to prevent plaintext storage in the database.
- **Database Storage:** Facilitates the storage of encrypted passwords within a MongoDB database.
- **Authentication Operations:** Provides functions for registering users with encrypted passwords and validating login credentials.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash-11-star/Encryption-Password-to-Database.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.

## Usage

Run the application using:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the application and provide the necessary interface to perform encryption and database storage of passwords.

## Dependencies
